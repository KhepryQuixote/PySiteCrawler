PySiteCrawler
=============

Python, Tor, Stem, Privoxy crawler of web site(s).

As this program is presently targeted for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, please use the following "recipe" to get it running:

##Tor##

Install Tor.
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tor
sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart
</pre>

*Notice that the socks listener is on port 9050.*

Next, do the following:

- Enable the ControlPort listener for Tor to listen on port 9051, as this is the port to which Tor will listen for any communication from applications talking to the Tor controller.
- Hash a new password that prevents random access to the port by outside agents.
- Implement cookie authentication as well.

You can create a hashed password out of your password using:
	
`tor --hash-password my_password`

Then, update the /etc/tor/torrc with the port, hashed password, and cookie authentication.

`sudo gedit /etc/tor/torrc`

<pre>
ControlPort 9051
# hashed password below is obtained via `tor --hash-password my_password`
HashedControlPassword 16:E600ADC1B52C80BB6022A0E999A7734571A451EB6AE50FED489B72E3DF
CookieAuthentication 1
</pre>

Restart Tor again to the configuration changes are applied.
	
`sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart`

##python-stem##

Next, install `python-stem` which is a Python-based module used to interact with the Tor Controller, letting us send and receive commands to and from the Tor Control port programmatically.

<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-stem
</pre>

##privoxy##

Tor itself is not a http proxy. So in order to get access to the Tor Network, we will use `privoxy` as an http-proxy though socks5.

Install `privoxy` via the following command:
	
`sudo apt-get install privoxy`

Now, tell `privoxy` to use TOR by routing all traffic through the SOCKS servers at localhost port 9050.

`sudo gedit /etc/privoxy/config`

and enable `forward-socks5` as follows:
	
`forward-socks5 / localhost:9050`

Restart `privoxy` after making the change to the configuration file.
	
`sudo /etc/init.d/privoxy restart`

##Python Script##

In the script below, `urllib2` is using the proxy. `privoxy` listens on port 8118 by default, and forwards the traffic to port 9050 upon which the Tor socks is listening.

Additionally, in the `renew_connection()` function,  a signal is being sent to the Tor controller to change the identity, so you get new identities without restarting Tor. Doing such comes in handy when crawling a web site and one doesnâ€™t wanted to be blocked based on IP address.

        # refresh the TOR connection
        renew_connection()
        # obtain the "new" IP address
        newIP = request("http://icanhazip.com/")

    # zero the 
    # elapsed seconds    
    seconds = 0

    # loop until the "new" IP address
    # is different than the "old" IP address,
    # as it may take the TOR network some
    # time to effect a different IP address
    while oldIP == newIP:
        # sleep this thread
        # for the specified duration
        time.sleep(secondsBetweenChecks)
        # track the elapsed seconds
        seconds += secondsBetweenChecks
        # obtain the current IP address
        newIP = request("http://icanhazip.com/")
        # signal that the program is still awaiting a different IP address
        print ("%d seconds elapsed awaiting a different IP address." % seconds)
    # output the
    # new IP address
    print ("")
    print ("newIP: %s" % newIP)
</pre>

Execute the Python 2.7 script above via the following command:
	
`python test_tor_stem_privoxy.py`

The IP address change every few seconds.
